## 🎯 Objective

```
Be able to start an online business with a Web Application.
```

## 🎣 Philosophy and Methodology

The idea of this course is **to embark you on the entrepreneurial journey to build your own web application to solve a real-world problem**. From Data to manipulate to Users to influence. 

I follow the **Industry best practices** with a 3-months-path with **1 dedicated theme by month**:

1. 🏁 **Theme 1 - Javascript World Domination**. How JavaScript is eating the world.
2. 🏗 **Theme 2 - Node.js, Master of Universe**. How we can build a client and server application with the same language.
3. 🧬 **Theme 3 - Web is Human**. How to influence users to click.

For each theme, I share a **collection of useful links** to deep diving in 3 parts:

* **📖 Must Read** - Useful links **to read as blog post** or github link.
* **🍿 Must Watch** - At least 1 talk or podcast link could help you **to learn in a passive or active context** (commuting, workout...).
* **👩🏽‍💻 Just tell me what to do** - **To be ready** for the month of the workshop days: links to tutorials to do, stuff to install...
* **The 🌟 link**. If you have just 30 minutes in your student busy life: **Read the 🌟 link**

I try to reach 14 hours of work by week (2h by day, Monday to Sunday).

## 🛣️ The 3 Themes

🏁 [Theme 1 - Javascript World Domination](./themes/1.md)

🏗 [Theme 2 - Node.js , Master of Universe](./themes/2.md)

🧬 [Theme 3 - Web is Human](./themes/3.md)

## 👩‍💻 Just tell me what to do ... after this 3 months... for the next days, weeks, months ... even years

Before to deep dive into the Web Ecosystem, I recommend to **build a strong JavaScript understanding foundation**.
If you are ready to learn, the following path [JavaScript Course - Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) is a good start to dig in from foundations to advanced JavaScript features.

For the new decade, take a look at some trends data with [State of JavaScript
](https://stateofjs.com/en-US).
An annual developer survey of the JavaScript ecosystem since 2016.

Then you can **follow these awesome paths to understand the UX Design role**: [UX Design - Step by step guide to becoming a UX Designer in 2025](https://roadmap.sh/ux-design). Or a [Full Stack](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) approach.
